# F1 Race Prediction Engine

A modular Formula 1 race simulation and prediction engine built in Python.

This project models race outcomes using historical data, engineered performance features, and probabilistic simulation techniques to generate race result forecasts.

---

## Overview

The F1 Race Prediction Engine is designed to:

- Ingest and process historical race data  
- Engineer performance features for drivers and sessions  
- Simulate race outcomes using probabilistic methods  
- Generate race summaries and prediction outputs  

The architecture emphasizes clean structure, modular design, and reproducibility.
